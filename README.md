# Guess The Number

ðŸŽ® **Guess The Number** is a simple console-based game where the user attempts to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100.

## How It Works

1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The user makes guesses, and the program provides hints:
   - **"A lot higher!"** or **"Higher!"** if the guess is too low.
   - **"A lot lower!"** or **"Lower!"** if the guess is too high.
3. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
4. Once the correct number is guessed, the program congratulates the player.
